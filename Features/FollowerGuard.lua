-- FollowerGuard notices someone who keeps ending up in your server and gets
-- you out of the game before a stranger watches a bot farm: the same player
-- seen in your servers again and again inside FOLLOWER_WINDOW is following
-- you, and on a trip the local player is kicked, which disconnects the client
-- to the Roblox app and ends the run. Only when the kick itself fails does the
-- old hold come back: Auto Farm goes off and stays off. Only a real click on
-- the Auto Farm toggle turns it back on -- a profile load sets the flag
-- directly and is never obeyed while the hold is on -- and turning it on by
-- hand also moves the count's start, so the same old sightings cannot trip it
-- straight away.
--
--   Sighting    one player in one server: someone already here when the
--               guard starts ("present"), or someone joining while it runs
--               ("joined"). "Present" counts once per player and server for
--               as long as the log remembers it, so re-running the script in
--               the same server cannot make a bystander look like a follower.
--   Trip        FOLLOWER_TRIP_SIGHTINGS sightings of one player inside the
--               window. A trip kicks you out of the game, which ends the run;
--               the same player seen again FOLLOWER_RETRIP_COOLDOWN later is
--               only reached after a trip whose kick failed and fell back to
--               the hold.
--   Exempt      you, the Block Whitelist and the Party Leader -- those are
--               people who are meant to be around you (the Leader is even
--               followed on purpose).
--
-- Sightings and the hold live in FOLLOWER_FILE, shared by every profile and
-- PlaceId like MobDrops.json, so the window carries across re-runs of the
-- script. The player is never blocked or reported: the guard only gets you
-- out of the game.
